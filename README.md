# Pesto 🌿
Welcome to Pesto! A creative coding environment inspired by love2d, but with some tasty twists to make your game development experience even more enjoyable. Named after the delicious Italian sauce, Pesto also brings a touch of green to your projects, just like the basil it's made from. Buon appetito! 🇮🇹 🍝

# Why Pesto? 💚
While love2d is a fantastic game engine with a minimalistic approach, it's missing some key features that most projects need. These include vectors, math functions, animation, AI, resolution scaling, collision detection, OOP, cameras, tweening, serialization, and UI, among others. To overcome these limitations, love2d users often turn to third-party libraries, which can be slow, buggy, and have inconsistent APIs. This is where Pesto comes in!

Pesto is a lightweight love2d alternative based on Raylib and other amazing libraries, aiming to fix these shortcomings and provide a smooth out-of-the-box experience. We hope you enjoy using Pesto as much as we enjoyed creating it, and we welcome any contributions! 🎮 🚀

# Features ✨
Pesto comes with all the essential features baked in, so you don't need to mix and match multiple libraries. Some of the included features are:

- Vectors, math functions, and animation
- AI, resolution scaling, and collision detection
- OOP, cameras, and tweening
- Serialization and UI

And much more! Pesto aims to provide everything you need to start creating your game projects without any hassle.

# Libraries 📚
Pesto is made possible thanks to these awesome libraries:
